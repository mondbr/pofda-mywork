# Principles of Data Analytics
by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for assignment project for  Principles of Data Analytics module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in Summer 2023/24. 

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure students can demonstrate the following:
 
- Source and investigate sets of data.
- Programmatically explore and visualize data.
- Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets. 
- Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
- Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
- Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.

## Assessment Overview 

The assessment consists of three parts: tasks, a project, and a presentation component, all submitted in one Jupyter notebook on this GitHub repository. 

It centers around the Palmer Penguins dataset, which we were discussing during the module.
 
The goal is to create a portfolio for future job applications, where presentation matters to employers.

## About this project

The Palmer Penguins dataset is a very popular dataset in data analytics particularly for educational purposes. It is a collection of data about penguins, including various measurements and characteristics such as species, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. 
This project is about:

1. Creating a repository with appropriate elements,
2. Giving an overview of the of the data set and the variables it contains,
3. Analysing the types of variables that should be used to model the variables in the data set
4. Visualisng data by creating varoius types of plots
5. Analysing two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are.


## Get Started

To get started with Jupyter Notebook files you need Python installed on your machine. To do that, you can use the following: 

**Anaconda**
https://www.anaconda.com/download
The easiest way to install Python and the necessary packages for this course.

**Visual Studio Code**
https://code.visualstudio.com/
The editor we will use to create Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

**Git**
https://git-scm.com/
The software we will use to track our progress.


## Use of this project 

This project is mainly created for the assessment and learning purposes, however it can be used for further analysis or educational purposes.

## About me: 

My name is Monika Dabrowska and I am an [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) student of first semester of Programming and Scripting module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course in Summer 2023/24. I don't have any prevoius programming experience nor knowledge of basing coding, so I am using multiple sources and references to help me to complete the assignments.
