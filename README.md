# Principles of Data Analytics
by Monika Dabrowska

 I am an [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) student. 

 This repository is for assignment project for  Principles of Data Analytics module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in Summer 2023/24. 

 The purpose of the assessment is to ensure students can demonstrate the following:
 
 - Source and investigate sets of data.
 - Programmatically explore and visualize data.
 - Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets. 
 - Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
 - Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
 - Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.

 ## Assessment Overview 

 The assessment consists of three parts: tasks, a project, and a presentation component, all submitted in one Jupyter notebook on this GitHub repository. 

 It centers around the Palmer Penguins dataset, which we were discussing during the module.
 
 The goal is to create a portfolio for future job applications, where presentation matters to employers.

 ## Indroduction (about this project)

 ## Get Started

    To get started with Jupyter Notebook files you need Python installed on your machine. To do that, you can use the following: 

    **Anaconda**

    https://www.anaconda.com/download

    *The easiest way to install Python and the necessary packages for this course.*


    **Visual Studio Code**

    https://code.visualstudio.com/

    *The editor we will use to create Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.*


    **Git**

    https://git-scm.com/

    *The software we will use to track our progress.*
