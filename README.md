# Principles of Data Analytics
by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the assignment project for the Principles of Data Analytics module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at ATU in the summer semester of 2023/24. 

The assessment aims to ensure students can demonstrate the following:
 
- Sourcing and investigating data sets. 
- Programmatically exploring and visualizing data.
- Applying basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
- Modeling real-world problems for computer analysis.
- Providing evidence in decision-making processes using data sets.
- Recognizing the limitations of graphical representations in data-intensive workflows.

## Assessment Overview 

The assessment consists of three parts: tasks, a project, and a presentation component, all submitted in one Jupyter notebook on this GitHub repository. 

It is focusing on the Palmer Penguins dataset, which we were discussing during the module.
 
The goal is to create a portfolio for future job applications, where presentation matters to employers.

## About this project

The Palmer Penguins dataset is widely used in data analytics particularly for educational purposes. It is a collection of data about penguins, including various measurements and characteristics such as species, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. 

This project involves:

1. Creating a repository with appropriate elements,
2. Giving an overview of the of the data set and the variables it contains,
3. Analysing the types of variables that should be used to model the variables in the data set,
4. Visualisng data by creating varoius types of plots,
5. Analysing two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are.


## Get Started

To begin with Jupyter Notebook files you need Python installed on your machine. To do that, you can use the following: 

**Anaconda** \
[Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) \
The easiest way to install Python and the necessary packages for this course.

**Visual Studio Code** \
[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com) \
The editor we will use to create Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. 

**Git** \
[Download](https://git-scm.com) \
The software we will use to track our progress.


## Use of this project 

This project is mainly created for the assessment and learning purposes, but it can be used for further analysis or educational purposes.

## Objectives:

Find and explore pattern and correlation in penguin attributes between numerical variables such as body mass, flipper length, bill depth, and/or bill length.


## Data Collection and Methodology:

The penguins data collected through field observations and scientific studies was downloaded from [Pamler Penguins Dataset Online](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) and loaded to the Jupyter Notebook in this repository. 

I worked on this project using Python programming and libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization. I also reffered to multiple resourses available online. 
 
## Results:
 
 I observed strong positive correlation (r = 0.87) between body mass and flipper length, suggesting that larger penguins tend to have longer flippers.
